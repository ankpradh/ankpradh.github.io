      <p>Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has evolved as an efficient and secure method for storage of data with fine-grained access control in cloud platforms. In recent years, increasing diversification in the design of ABE schemes has led to significant research in the assimilation of properties like traceability, revocation, and outsourcing decryption. However, most of the recent ABE schemes incorporate few of these properties and hence lack in robustness to adapt with varying demands of cloud systems. In modern ABE designs, the notions of forward and backward secrecy have been introduced to accommodate the delegation of a large number of heterogeneous users in the system. In general, these features are realized under the concept of user revocation. On the other hand, to control malicious users in the system, it is necessary to implement traceability in integration with user revocation. Finally, for resource-constrained users, outsourcing decryption to proxy servers is a viable option. Thus, we propose PMTER-ABE, a practical decentralized multi-authority traceable and efficiently revocable attribute-based cryptosystem with outsourcing decryption advantage. The key features of our cryptosystem are (i) incorporating large attribute universe with highly expressive policies, (ii) integrating forward and backward secrecy under user revocation, (iii) implementing white-box traceability to detect malicious users, and (iv) outsourcing decryption to reduce the computational overhead of decryption on users. We present the formal proofs for correctness, security, and traceability of PMTER-ABE along with performance analysis. The efficiency and usability of PMTER-ABE is shown with practical implementation and experimental results.</p>

      <p>Smart grid employs intelligent transmission and distribution networks for effective and reliable delivery of electricity. It uses fine-grained electrical measurements to attain optimized reliability and stability by sharing these measurements among different entities of energy management systems of the grid. There are many stakeholders like users, phasor measurement units (PMU), and other entities, with changing requirements involved in the sharing of the data. Therefore, data security plays a vital role in the correct functioning of a power grid network. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based encryption (ABE) for secure data sharing in Smart Grid architectures as ABE enables efficient and secure access control. Also, the access policy is obfuscated to preserve privacy. We use Linear Secret Sharing (LSS) Scheme for supporting any monotone access structures, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of access policies. Finally, we also analyze the security, access policy privacy and collusion resistance properties along with efficiency analysis of our cryptosystem.</p>

      <p>Multi-authority ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is one of the promising approaches where multiple authorities issue and manage various attributes to achieve fine-grained access control on stored data in cloud platforms. However, the practical use of multi-authority CP-ABE (MCP-ABE) requires satisfaction of different features. Firstly, in MCP-ABE, users having the same set of attributes must share the same decryption privileges. This may potentially lead to exposure of decryption keys by some malicious users. Thus, there is a need of designing MCP-ABE with traceability to overcome this problem. Secondly, as the cost of decryption increases with the complexity of access policy, it is preferred to provide the functionality of outsourcing decryption to reduce the computational burden on the user. Finally, the data owners must have flexibility to change the access policy. Hence, policy updation must be an integral part of MCP-ABE scheme. In this paper, we construct a new multi-authority CP-ABE scheme over large attribute universe with decentralization of authorities that supports white-box traceability along with policy updation and outsourcing decryption. Our proposed cryptosystem is built on prime order groups and supports monotonic access structures. These features improve efficiency and expressiveness of our system. We implemented our proposed cryptosystem in Charm cryptographic framework and analyzed its performance with a diverse set of test cases.</p>

      <p>In recent years, cyberbullying has grown out of proportion due to the increasing usage of social media platforms along with the benefit of user anonymization over the Internet. Affecting people across all demographics, the effect of cyberbullying has been more pronounced over adolescents and insecure individuals. Victims suffer from societal isolation, depression, degrading self-confidence and suicidal thoughts. Thus, prevention of cyberbullying becomes a necessity and requires timely detection. Recent advances in Deep learning and Natural Language Processing have provided suitable models to predict whether a text sample is an example of cyberbullying. In this context, we explore the adaptivity and efficiency of self-attention models in detecting cyberbullying. Though a few of the recent works in this context have employed models like deep neural networks, SVM, CNN, LSTM and other hybrid models, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring self-attention models which have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in Machine Translation tasks since 2017. We experiment with the Wikipedia, Formspring and Twitter cyberbullying datasets and achieve more efficient results over existing cyberbullying detection models. We also propose new research directions within cyberbullying detection over recent forms of media like Internet memes which pose a variety of new and hybrid problems.</p>

      <p>Smart grid consists of multiple different entities related to various energy management systems which share fine-grained energy measurements among themselves in an optimal and reliable manner. Such delivery is achieved through intelligent transmission and distribution networks composed of various stakeholders like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), Master and Remote Terminal Units (MTU and RTU), Storage Centers and users in power utility departments subject to volatile changes in requirements. Hence, secure accessibility of data becomes vital in the context of efficient functioning of the smart grid. In this paper, we propose a practical attribute-based encryption scheme for securing data sharing and data access in Smart Grid architectures with the added advantage of obfuscating the access policy. This is aimed at preserving data privacy in the context of competing smart grid operators. We build our scheme on Linear Secret Sharing (LSS) Schemes for supporting any monotone access structures and thus enhancing the expressiveness of access policies. Lastly, we analyze the security, access policy privacy and collusion resistance properties of our cryptosystem and provide an efficiency comparison as well as experimental analysis using the Charm-Crypto framework to validate the proficiency of our proposed solution.</p>

      <p>Let \(G\) be a simple graph. By an independent set in \(G\), we mean a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in \(G\). The independence polynomial of \(G\) is defined as \(I_{G}(z)=i_0 + i_1 z + i_2 z^2+\cdots +i_\alpha z^{\alpha }\), where \(i_m=i_m(G)\) is the number of independent sets in \(G\) with cardinality \(m\) and \(\alpha =\alpha (G)\) denotes the cardinality of a largest independent set in \(G\) (known as the independence number of \(G\)). Let \(G^k\) denote the \(k\)-times lexicographic product of \(G\) with itself. The set of roots of \(I_{G^k}\) is known to converge as \(k\) tends to \(\infty\), with respect to the Hausdorff metric, and the limiting set is known as the independence attractor. The independence fractal of a graph is the limiting set of roots of the reduced independence polynomial \(I_{G^k}-1\) of \(G^k\) as \(k\) tends to \(\infty\). In this article, we consider the independence fractals of graphs with independence number 3. We attempt to find all such graphs whose independence fractal is a line segment. It is shown that the independence fractal and the independence attractor coincide when the earlier is a line segment. The line segment turns out to be an interval \([-\frac{4}{k}, 0]\) for \(k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\). It is found that each of these graphs have 9 vertices and there are exactly 13 such disconnected graphs. We show that there does not exist any connected graph for \(k = 4\). For \(k = 1\), there are 17 such connected graphs and for \(k = 2, 3\) the number is quite large.</p>

      <p>Today a large volume of data is stored in cloud that requires fine grained accessibility for heterogeneous users. Cipher-text policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) has evolved into a promising solution for secure data storage with fine grained access control. In CP-ABE, the ciphertext is associated with an access policy (set of rules) and users can access the data if their attributes satisfies the access policy. However, existing CP-ABE schemes fail to perform in presence of large number of users and hierarchical relationships among them. Moreover, a majority of the CP-ABE schemes require large computational overhead for light weight applications. In this paper, we present a hierarchical attribute based cryptosystem by introducing hierarchical dependency between the users and thereby achieving multi-layer verification for fine grained data access. Moreover, our proposed cryptosystem is seamless to user revocation. The efficiency and security of our proposed cryptosystem have been analyzed and reported. Further we implement the proposed cryptosystem in Charm to demonstrate its practicality.</p>

      <p>Cellular automata (CA) has attracted the attention of research communities for its applications in the design of symmetric and public-key cryptosystems. The strength of cellular automata lies in its inherent data parallelism, which can help accelerate access control mechanisms, and its information scrambling capabilities, which can enhance the security of the system. Also, the cryptosystems designed using CA do not involve number-theoretic methodologies that incur large computational overhead like traditional cryptosystems. However, existing CA-based cryptosystems encompass a limited set from the set of all possible transition rules indicating the existence of CA cryptosystems which are possibly unbreakable but have not been explored sufficiently. Thus, they have not yet been considered for applications involving fine-grained access control for heterogeneous access to the data. In this paper, we propose a secure distributed multi-authority attribute-based encryption using CA, which has potential applications in cloud systems. Our cryptosystem adopts the concept of multi-authority attribute-based access control where the encryption and attribute distribution use reversible CA, and policy satisfiability is achieved by Turing-complete CA in a distributed environment. We illustrate the practical usability of our proposed cryptosystem, in terms of efficiency and security, by extensive experimental results.</p>
